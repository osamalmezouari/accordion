# Accordion

Welcome to the Single Page Q&A Component, a React application built with Vite. This interactive component presents a curated list of questions, and each question comes with a responsive answer that is revealed upon user interaction.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Question List:** Explore a thoughtfully crafted list of questions covering various topics.
